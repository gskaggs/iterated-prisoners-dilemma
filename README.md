A repository for my experiments with iterated prisoner's delima.

### Resources 

- [The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins](https://www.amazon.com/Selfish-Gene-Anniversary-Landmark-Paperback/dp/B0722G5V92/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=The+Selfish+Gene&qid=1591506014&sr=8-2#customerReviews) original sparked my curiosity in the concept of evolutionary stable strategies and simulations of iterated prisoner's delima.
- [The Stanford's Encyclapedia of Philosophy's entry on the Prisoner's Delima](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/prisoner-dilemma/#ZeroDeteStra) beautifuly summerizes developments both before and after Axelrod's original tournament and contains a wealth of references for future enquiry.
- ["Evolution of iterated prisoner's dilemma strategies with different history lengths in static and cultural environments" by Brunauer and Mayer](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220999970_Evolution_of_iterated_prisoner's_dilemma_strategies_with_different_history_lengths_in_static_and_cultural_environments) pursues the use of genetic algorithms to produce effective iterated prisoner's delima strategies.
