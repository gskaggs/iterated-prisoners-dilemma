# Genetic Algorithms for Iterated Prisoner's Delimma Strategies

My implementation and adaptation of the paper ["Evolution of iterated prisoner's dilemma strategies with different history lengths in static and cultural environments"](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220999970_Evolution_of_iterated_prisoner's_dilemma_strategies_with_different_history_lengths_in_static_and_cultural_environments) by Brunauer and Mayer. 

### Execution

To most easily view output results, I recommend:

`python3 main.py > output.txt`

### Configuration

- *tourney_config.py* contains values pertinent to an individual game of iterated prisoner's delimma.
- *strategies/genetic_config.py* contains values pertinent to the incorporated genetic algorithms.
